### Patch Changes

- 185e468: Plugin loader falls back to manual exports-map resolution for pure-ESM
  plugins. Previously a plugin whose published `exports` map only declared
  the `import` condition (no `default`, no `require`, no top-level `main`)
  failed to load because `createRequire().resolve()` couldn't see the
  `import` condition. Affected `@tailored-ai/google-tools@0.1.1` —
  restarting the agent after a fresh `tai plugin install` produced
  "plugin … is not installed" even though it was.

  Two changes ship together:

  - `@tailored-ai/cli`: the plugin loader now tries `createRequire().resolve`
    first, then walks the plugin's own `package.json` exports map by hand
    (`exports["."].import` / `default` / `require`, then `module` / `main`)
    and dynamic-imports the resolved file path. Pure-ESM plugins load
    without the author having to publish a CJS-visible entry condition.
  - `@tailored-ai/google-tools`: the `exports` map now also exposes a
    `default` condition so older versions of the loader still resolve this
    package correctly via the CJS path.

  A regression test covers the pure-ESM-only layout end-to-end in the
  plugin manager's importer.

### Patch Changes

- dddf565: Migrate `@tailored-ai/google-tools` to the `register(ctx)` plugin contract (closes #55). The package previously registered Gmail / GoogleCalendar / GoogleDrive via module-load side effects, which broke when installed via `tai plugin install` outside the host's resolution tree (same class of bug as channel-slack pre-#47). Default export is now a `Plugin` function the host invokes with a `PluginContext`. CLI drops its `@tailored-ai/google-tools` workspace dep — Google tools are now fully optional, opt-in via `plugins: ["@tailored-ai/google-tools"]` in config.yaml.
- f585b70: Release build now covers every publishable package (closes #56). The root `build` script previously enumerated packages by hand and forgot `channel-slack` and `google-tools`; `pnpm publish -r` would have shipped them with stale or missing `dist/` output. Build is now `pnpm -r run build` and the release workflow runs a new `pnpm run pack:check` smoke that packs every public package and asserts each tarball contains `dist/index.js`. The Changesets fixed group adds `channel-slack` and `google-tools` so they version in lockstep with `core`'s plugin contract.
- c87fce0: Initial public release.

Workflow async-trigger pollers (file_drop, email, calendar, rss, geofence, weather, sensor, finance, home_assistant) now reconcile against the live workflow registry instead of being wired once at CLI startup. New `WorkflowTriggerCoordinator` listens to registry change events and runs a per-workflow set diff: adds new triggers, removes triggers for deleted workflows, restarts triggers whose config changed, and leaves untouched any workflow whose triggers match the last signature (no duplicate timers). Each poller class gains an `unregister(workflowName)` method for the diff path. Closes #65.

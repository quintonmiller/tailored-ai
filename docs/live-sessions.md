# Live sessions

Talk with an agent out loud: you speak, it answers in its own voice within a
couple of seconds. Everything runs on local models: speech-to-text, the agent
on your local model, then text-to-speech. A cloud service can stand in for any
stage, but none is needed. The design, with the measurements behind it, is in
[live-sessions-design.md](./live-sessions-design.md).

> **Status:** the core pieces are in: the speech stages, voice mode, and the
> spoken turn. The web transport (a push-to-talk page) is next; until it lands,
> nothing in the UI starts a session.

## Setting it up

You need two local servers that speak the OpenAI audio API, plus the
language model you already run:

- **Speech-to-text:** any `/v1/audio/transcriptions` server, for example a
  faster-whisper wrapper. faster-whisper `small` on the GPU transcribes a
  sentence in about 0.1 s; on the CPU it takes 1.5–2.5 s, which works but
  is slow.
- **Text-to-speech:** any `/v1/audio/speech` server. Kokoro-FastAPI runs on
  the CPU and says a short sentence in about 0.2 s.

```yaml
live:
  enabled: true
  stt:
    options: { baseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:8900/v1, model: small, language: en }
  tts:
    options: { baseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1, model: kokoro, format: mp3 }
    voice: af_heart
  limits: { maxMinutes: 30, idleMinutes: 10, maxTurns: 200 }   # the defaults
```

`stt.provider` and `tts.provider` default to `openai_compatible`. A plugin can
register another stage (`registerSpeechToText`, `registerTextToSpeech`) and
name it there. `apiKey` in a stage's options is sent as a bearer token.

## Voice mode

Voice is a mode on an agent, not a separate agent. In a live session the agent
keeps its identity and history, and gets a smaller, faster turn:

- its `voice.instructions`, or else a short guide to talking ("one to three
  short spoken sentences, nothing that can't be read aloud") followed by its
  own instructions
- only the tools named in `voice.tools`, none by default
- reasoning off, replies capped at `voice.maxTokens` (300 by default), and no
  injected memory

```yaml
agents:
  planner:
    instructions: You keep plans tidy.
    voice:
      tools: [state]        # what it can still do while talking
      voice: am_adam        # its own voice; otherwise live.tts.voice
```

A spoken turn is an ordinary agent turn, with the same loop, tools, limits,
guardrails and history. The reply is spoken a sentence at a time while the
model is still writing, so the first words come out before the reply is done.

## Why the prompt has to stay the same

The model answers quickly only when it has the start of the prompt cached: on
the reference machine the first word takes ~25 ms with a cached prefix, and
~470 ms for a 2,000-token prompt without one. Voice mode keeps the system
prompt and tool list byte-identical from turn to turn, and a test checks it.
Anything that changes each turn (live state, recalled memory, pinned state)
goes after the conversation, where it doesn't break the cache. If you
customise `systemPrompt.order`, keep those layers in the tail.

## Limits

A session ends itself after `maxMinutes`, after `idleMinutes` without a turn,
or at `maxTurns`, and says which. On local hardware the cost is GPU time
rather than money, but a forgotten tab shouldn't hold the speech stages
forever.
